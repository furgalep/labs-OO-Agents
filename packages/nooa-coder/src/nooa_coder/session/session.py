"""Session: one agent's durable record, built around the agent's own turn loop.

The agent's ``TurnLoop`` (``agent.turns``) races its channels and runs
the turns; it knows nothing about sessions. The Session is the producer
and the recorder around it: items go in on the agent's queue channels
(``submit``), each recorded (``ItemAdmitted``) before it is put, so nothing
admitted is lost. The Session learns what happened from the agent's
events (``ChannelItemConsumed`` / ``ChannelItemsDiscarded`` from the
channels, ``TurnBegan`` / ``TurnSettled`` from the loop) and turns them
into the ledger, prompt outcomes, checkpoints and session updates.
